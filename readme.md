# Conjure Oxide

This repository contains the in-progress Conjure Oxide constraints modelling
tool and its dependencies. 

This repository hosts the following projects:

* [Conjure Oxide](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide/tree/main/conjure_oxide)
* [`minion_rs` - Rust bindings to Minion](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide/tree/main/solvers/minion)

This project is being produced by staff and students of University of St
Andrews, and is licenced under the [MPL 2.0](./LICENCE).

## Rust Nightly Support

The following compiler flags are required for Conjure-Oxide to work with
Nightly Rust:

```sh
export RUSTFLAGS="-Zlinker-features=-lld" 
export RUSTDOCFLAGS="-Zlinker-features=-lld" 
cargo build <...>
```

This is because of current incompatibilities with linkme and the new default
linker ([link](https://github.com/dtolnay/linkme/issues/94)).
